## Overview
This repository contains code for the **TMLR Paper** "[Neural Clamping: Joint Input Perturbation and Temperature Scaling for Neural Network Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11604)." The research
demo of Neural Clamping can be found at [NCTV: Neural Clamping Toolkit and Visualization for Neural Network Calibration](https://huggingface.co/spaces/TrustSafeAI/NCTV), which earlier appeared in [AAAI 2023 Demo Track](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16274).
